## UI/organisms

**DEFINITION**: Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

Organisms can consist of similar or different molecule types. A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form. We see these types of organisms on almost every website we visit.

Organisms can fetch data from the DB to configure children components (molecules or atoms), or also set data to shared stores (via hooks as well, not Redux).
