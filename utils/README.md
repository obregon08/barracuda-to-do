## Utils

**DEFINITION**: A folder containing utility files to perform common tasks. ie. error handling, read/write cookies, developer console logging, etc.

The difference between a `services` and `utils` is that `utils` do NOT make network requests. They could manipulate data, for example to parse a string and get the "nouns" and "verbs" from a sentence.
